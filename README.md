# Slime-a-clysm

A mod of Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead, where the world changes to one full of slime monsters instead of zombies

I also created my own various types of slime monsters and a slime forest that may appear in-game as well

How to use this mod:
- Have Cataclysm: DDA, 0.G stable installed 
- Place the "SlimeClysm" folder inside "data/mods"
