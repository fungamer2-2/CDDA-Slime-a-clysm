# Slime-a-clysm-MOD

A mod of Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead, where the world changes to one full of slime monsters instead of zombies

I also created my own various types of slime monsters and a slime forest that may appear in-game as well

**NOTE**: This mod is currently only designed for 0.G stable.
